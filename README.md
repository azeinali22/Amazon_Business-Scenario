## Applying ML to an NLP Problem

In this project, we will use the built-in machine learning (ML) model to predict whether a review is positive or negative.

## Business Scenario

we work for an online retail store that wants to enhance customer engagement by addressing negative reviews. The company aims to detect negative reviews and assign them to a customer service agent for resolution.

our task is to build an ML model that detects negative reviews. You have access to a dataset that contains reviews classified as either positive or negative. You will use this dataset to train an ML model that predicts the sentiment of new reviews.

## About the Dataset

The [AMAZON-REVIEW-DATA-CLASSIFICATION.csv](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-machine-learning-university-accelerated-nlp/tree/master/data/examples) file contains actual product reviews. Each review includes a sentiment classification: positive or negative. The dataset serves as training data for the ML model you will develop.
